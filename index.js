// Example of basic Arrays

//let vegetables = ["Caroot","Brocoli","Tomatoo","Spinach","Cucumber" ]
//console.log(vegetables);
//console.log(vegetables.length);// This is basically to see the length of the arrays information. Here it will be 5  as there are 5 vegetables item.
//Also length works as a property in JS which will show the value. 
//let marks = [50, 70, 80, 80, 40]
//console.log(marks);
//console.log(marks.length);

//Array indices(indices is plural of index)

// using array we can change anything as per our need. Example given below.
//let marks = [50, 70, 80, 80, 40]
//marks[1] = 20
//console.log(marks);//Here 70 changes to 20. As per index no 70 is in 1 serial/position. So we put serial 1 inside the array under the same variable name and mention the required new no
//let vegetables = ["Caroot","Brocoli","Tomatoo","Spinach","Cucumber" ]
//vegetables[2] = "Potatoo"
//console.log(vegetables);// Here Tomatoo replaced by the Potatoo

//How to use loop in arrays

//for loop

//let cities = ["Helsinki", "Tampere", "Oulu", "Turku"]
//for (let index = 0; index < cities.length; index++) {
    //console.log(cities[2]);
    
//}

//for-of loop

//let cities = ["Helsinki", "Tampere", "Oulu", "Turku"]
//for (let city of cities) {
    //console.log(city);
//}
